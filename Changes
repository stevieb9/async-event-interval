Revision history for Fork-Event-Interval

0.04 UNREL
        - added examples/shared.pl, shared variable between all events and
          the parent
        - major overhaul on PID handling which provided the ability to rework
          status() to be much more reliable (and effective)
        - we now set $SIG{CHLD}="IGNORE" to avoid defunct processes
        - added Carp (croak) for all fatal errors

0.03    2016-10-16
        - removed restart(), and aliased it instead to start()
        - fixed issue in an already-running warn on start(), and added status()
          to check the running status of an event (closes #1)
