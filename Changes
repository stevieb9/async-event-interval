1.00    2018-01-23
    - modified t/15-interval.t with some timing changes to prevent CPAN
      Testers failures

    - added examples/shared.pl, shared variable between all events and
      the parent
    - major overhaul on PID handling which provided the ability to rework
      status() to be much more reliable (and effective)
    - we now set $SIG{CHLD}="IGNORE" to avoid defunct processes
    - added Carp (croak) for all fatal errors
    - status() now returns -1 if an event has crashed, providing the user
      with the ability to restart the event, or take other action
    - added examples/timeout.pl and examples/event_crash.pl

0.03    2016-10-16
    - removed restart(), and aliased it instead to start()
